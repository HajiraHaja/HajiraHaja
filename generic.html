								<p>My passion for data analysis stems from my psychology degree, where a significant amount of work involved collecting data, manipulating data and using various statistical testing to analyse complex datasets from surveys, lab studies. I was astonished to learn how data can be used to answer many research questions.</p>
								<p>In order to gain deeper understanding of how data is used in organisation, I interned as a Research Assistant at WestCo, where I had hands-on experiences in interpreting business data in Excel and SPSS to provide strategic solutions to address the needs of clients. I was required to manage multiple projects, communicate with clients via emails to understand their requirements and write correspondence with key findings, displayed using appropriate infographics. I developed an ability to produce analytical reports to a high standard independently as well as with others, to exchange ideas, which has contributed positively to the outcome of the projects. I found it extremely rewarding to provide insights to companies by deriving meaningful insights from raw data, and I was amazed to see the positive impact such insights  has on organisations improving their service.</p>
								<p>As I wanted to further hone my knowledge of analytical tools, such as PowerBi and Python, and learn ways to interact with databases (e.g. SQL), I signed up to Generation UK and completed their intense hands on practical data analysts bootcamp. I have been acquiring  immense experience in applying my technical skills in different real-life simulation projects (e.g. Data Camp projects). Through various assessments including group projects and technical independent projects I enhanced my time-management and project management skills. I have had the chance to present my analysis on Adventureworks database and Olist e-commerce store to my fellow peers. This involved processing large datasets, analysing data (using python, Power BI and SQL) and presenting my findings. I have a proven record of meeting tight deadlines and producing work to a high standard by multi-tasking and breaking projects into manageable chunks. I believe that my experiences and skill set would be a great asset to the ongoing success of your company. The Programme has solidified my interest for this field further and I am reinforced that Data Analysis is the career that I want to pursue and invest in continuous learning.</p>
								<p>Applying to the Data Analyst role would be the ideal next step to achieve my career ambitions as I can gain hands-on experiences in analysing data and presenting my findings to external stakeholders at different levels of profession. I am keen to work collaboratively in a data analytic environment with expert colleagues who are working to achieve a combined goal. I find it extremely rewarding to utilise my strengths in data analysis to solve problems, help clients to achieve their objectives and provide evidence-based solutions to companies. I strongly believe that my recent Generation programme experience has equipped me with the required attributes and I am looking forward to advancing my skills through the learning and training opportunities, in order to become a competent Data Analyst with high proficiency in the core skills.  I am excited about the possibility of taking increased responsibilities in the role and progress to the Data Scientist role potentially. </p>
